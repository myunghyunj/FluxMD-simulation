## Comparison: Standard (CPU) vs UMA (GPU) Flux Fluctuation Calculation

Both the **standard (CPU)** and **UMA (GPU)** versions implement the same simplified flux formula, but they use different mathematical methods to calculate the temporal fluctuation term (**τᵢ**):

- **Standard (CPU) Version:**  
  Calculates τᵢ as the root-mean-square of the time derivative of the force magnitude at each residue (using numerical differentiation such as Savitzky-Golay filtering).

- **UMA (GPU) Version:**  
  Calculates τᵢ as the normalized standard deviation of the interaction energies at each residue (i.e., standard deviation divided by the mean, using statistical variance). The term (1 + τᵢ) is a weighting factor where the "1" represents the baseline contribution, and "τᵢ" acts as a bonus or amplifier based on the system's dynamics.The primary reason is to handle DivisionByZero errors and other issues that arise from performing calculations on empty data. The code is designed to "fail fast" with a clear error message rather than producing a nonsensical or empty output. This logic is implemented in the fluxmd/analysis/flux_analyzer_uma.py file.

### Unified View: Two Implementations of τᵢ

```python
# -------- CPU VERSION --------
# From: fluxmd/analysis/flux_analyzer.py -> calculate_tensor_flux_differentials

magnitudes = np.linalg.norm(smoothed_tensor, axis=1)

# Calculate rate of change using a numerical derivative
if len(magnitudes) > 1:
    if len(magnitudes) >= 5:
        window_length = min(5, len(magnitudes))
        mag_derivative = savgol_filter(
            magnitudes,
            window_length=window_length,
            polyorder=min(2, window_length-1),
            deriv=1
        )
    else:
        mag_derivative = np.gradient(magnitudes)

    rate_of_change = np.sqrt(np.mean(mag_derivative**2))  # This is τᵢ


# -------- GPU VERSION --------
# From: fluxmd/analysis/flux_analyzer_uma.py -> _calculate_flux_gpu_optimized

# 4. Temporal fluctuation (simplified as energy variance)
avg_energy = energy_sum / interaction_count

# Calculate variance using a second pass
squared_deviations = torch.zeros(self.n_residues, device=self.device)
for i in range(len(residue_ids)):
    res_id = residue_ids[i]
    deviation = torch.abs(energies[i]) - avg_energy[res_id]
    squared_deviations[res_id] += deviation ** 2

variance = squared_deviations / interaction_count
temporal_factor = 1.0 + torch.sqrt(variance) / (avg_energy + 1e-10)  # This is (1 + τᵢ)
